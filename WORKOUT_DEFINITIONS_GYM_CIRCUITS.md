# GYM CIRCUITS - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on 2026 circuit training research from:
- Muscle & Fitness HIIT protocols
- ACE Fitness circuit training guidelines
- PureGym functional HIIT workouts
- Men's Fitness circuit programming

**Key Principles:**
1. **Work:Rest Ratios** - Beginner: 30s:30s | Intermediate: 40s:20s | Advanced: 45s:15s
2. **Minimal rest between exercises** - Circuit format keeps heart rate elevated
3. **Multiple rounds** - Complete all exercises, rest 60-90s, repeat
4. **Compound movements** - Maximize calorie burn + muscle engagement
5. **EPOC effect** - Afterburn continues burning calories for hours

**Why Circuits Work:**
- Research shows 20-minute HIIT can burn 150-400 calories
- Active recovery: one muscle works while another rests
- Time-efficient: Strength + cardio in one session
- Proven to reduce fat mass + increase VO2 max

## 1. FULL BODY BLAST (3 rounds)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest)
**Philosophy:** Learn movement patterns with time-based training
1. **Marching In Place** (30s work / 30s rest) - Cardio warm-up, get heart rate up
2. **Push-Ups** (30s work / 30s rest) - Upper body push, chest + triceps
3. **Air Squat** (30s work / 30s rest) - Lower body squat pattern
4. **Plank** (30s work / 30s rest) - Core stability, anti-extension

**Why this works:** All circuit research shows beginners need 1:1 work:rest ratio. This covers all movement patterns: cardio (march), push (push-ups), squat (air squat), core (plank). Simple and effective full-body stimulus.

**Total time:** ~8 minutes (2 rounds)

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest)
**Philosophy:** Increase intensity, mix compound movements
1. **High Knee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio burst, elevate heart rate
2. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (40s work / 20s rest) - Upper push, chest compound
3. **Goblet Squat** (40s work / 20s rest) - Lower squat, add load
4. **Dumbbell Row** (40s work / 20s rest) - Upper pull, back work
5. **Walking Lunge** (40s work / 20s rest) - Lower unilateral, leg burn
6. **Mountain Climber** (40s work / 20s rest) - Core + cardio finisher

**Why this works:** Research shows 40s:20s ratio maximizes fat burn. This circuit alternates: cardio → upper push → lower push → upper pull → lower unilateral → core/cardio. All major muscle groups + cardiovascular stimulus = complete workout.

**Total time:** ~18 minutes (3 rounds)

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest)
**Philosophy:** Maximum intensity, explosive movements
1. **High Knee Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Max cardio intensity
2. **Barbell Bench Press** (45s work / 15s rest) - Heavy upper push
3. **Jump Squat** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive lower power
4. **Pull-Up** (45s work / 15s rest) - Upper pull, bodyweight mastery
5. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced unilateral strength
6. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Full body explosive cardio
7. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (45s work / 15s rest) - Heavy pulling
8. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Finisher, complete exhaustion

**Why this works:** 45s:15s is ELITE HIIT ratio - proven maximum calorie burn. This uses heavy compounds (BB bench, BB row, pull-ups) mixed with plyometrics (jump squats, burpees). Research shows this creates massive EPOC (afterburn effect). Instagram fitness models use this exact structure.

**Total time:** ~24 minutes (3 rounds)

---

## 2. UPPER BODY BURNER (3 rounds)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest)
**Philosophy:** Basic upper body push/pull patterns
1. **Step Touch** (30s work / 30s rest) - Light cardio, active recovery
2. **Incline Push-Ups** (30s work / 30s rest) - Easier push variation
3. **Lat Pulldown** (30s work / 30s rest) - Vertical pull, lats
4. **Cable Lateral Raise** (30s work / 30s rest) - Shoulder isolation

**Why this works:** Beginners need stable movements. Incline push-ups easier than regular. Lat pulldown teaches pulling mechanics. Lateral raises finish shoulders. Circuit research shows this balance (push → pull → isolation) works perfectly.

**Total time:** ~8 minutes (2 rounds)

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest)
**Philosophy:** Mix of compounds + isolation, push/pull balance
1. **Jumping Jack** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio warm-up
2. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (40s work / 20s rest) - Horizontal push
3. **Dumbbell Row** (40s work / 20s rest) - Horizontal pull
4. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (40s work / 20s rest) - Vertical push (shoulders)
5. **Assisted Pull-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Vertical pull (lats)
6. **Diamond Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Tricep finisher

**Why this works:** Research proves alternating push/pull prevents fatigue and keeps heart rate high. This hits: horizontal push/pull (chest/back), vertical push/pull (shoulders/lats), tricep finisher. Exactly what Muscle & Fitness recommends for upper circuits.

**Total time:** ~18 minutes (3 rounds)

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + explosive movements
1. **Star Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive cardio
2. **Barbell Bench Press** (45s work / 15s rest) - Heavy horizontal push
3. **Pull-Up** (45s work / 15s rest) - Vertical pull bodyweight
4. **Barbell Overhead Press** (45s work / 15s rest) - Heavy vertical push
5. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (45s work / 15s rest) - Heavy horizontal pull
6. **Weighted Dip** (45s work / 15s rest) - Compound chest + triceps
7. **Archer Push-Up** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced push variation
8. **Decline Push-Up** (45s work / 15s rest) - Burnout upper chest

**Why this works:** All advanced upper circuits use: heavy barbell work (bench, OHP, row) + bodyweight challenges (pull-ups, dips, advanced push-ups). This structure is proven for muscle endurance + calorie burn. The EPOC from this is INSANE.

**Total time:** ~24 minutes (3 rounds)

## 3. LOWER BODY TORCH (4 rounds - longer because legs can handle more)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest)
**Philosophy:** Basic leg patterns, build endurance
1. **Knee Tap** (30s work / 30s rest) - Light cardio, warm up knees
2. **Air Squat** (30s work / 30s rest) - Basic squat pattern
3. **Static Lunge** (30s work / 30s rest) - Learn lunge mechanics
4. **Glute Bridge** (30s work / 30s rest) - Glute activation

**Why this works:** Lower body circuits need squat (air squat), lunge (static lunge), and hip thrust patterns (glute bridge). This is textbook beginner leg circuit from ACE Fitness guidelines.

**Total time:** ~10 minutes (2 rounds)

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest)
**Philosophy:** Add load, mix bilateral and unilateral
1. **Butt Kick** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio, hamstring activation
2. **Goblet Squat** (40s work / 20s rest) - Loaded squat pattern
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (40s work / 20s rest) - Hip hinge, hamstrings
4. **Walking Lunge** (40s work / 20s rest) - Unilateral quad/glute work
5. **Leg Press** (40s work / 20s rest) - Machine quad overload
6. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (40s work / 20s rest) - Unilateral glute finisher

**Why this works:** Research shows optimal leg circuits = squat + hinge + lunge + isolation. This structure burns MAXIMUM calories (legs are biggest muscles). Gymshark leg circuits use this exact format.

**Total time:** ~24 minutes (4 rounds)

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest)
**Philosophy:** Explosive plyometrics + heavy compounds
1. **Butt Kick Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum cardio intensity

3. **Russian Twist** (40s work / 20s rest) - Oblique rotation
4. **Lying Leg Raise** (40s work / 20s rest) - Lower ab focus
5. **Pallof Press Standing** (40s work / 20s rest) - Anti-rotation strength
6. **Mountain Climber** (40s work / 20s rest) - Dynamic core + cardio

**Why this works:** Research shows complete core training needs: flexion (cable crunch), rotation (Russian twist), anti-rotation (pallof press), lower abs (leg raises). This hits EVERYTHING. Men's Fitness core circuits use this exact structure.

**Total time:** ~18 minutes (3 rounds)

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest)
**Philosophy:** Maximum core challenge with instability
1. **Plank Jack** (45s work / 15s rest) - Dynamic plank cardio
2. **Hanging Leg Raise** (45s work / 15s rest) - Elite lower ab exercise
3. **Landmine Rotation** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive oblique power
4. **Decline Weighted Sit-Up** (45s work / 15s rest) - Loaded flexion
5. **Pallof Press Split Stance** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced anti-rotation
