# HOME BODYWEIGHT BASICS - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on 2026 home fitness trends:
- **Circuit training format** (most popular home workout style)
- **Push-up progressions** (Men's Health all-pushup programs)
- **Bodyweight fundamentals** (Nerd Fitness beginner protocols)
- **2026 fitness trends** (ACSM reports: wearables, AI, strength focus)
- **Calisthenics movements** (28-day challenges, progressive bodyweight)

**WHAT'S POPULAR AT HOME:**
1. **Circuit format** - 20-min circuits with minimal rest
2. **Push-up variations** - Most versatile upper body exercise
3. **Bodyweight squats & lunges** - No equipment leg work
4. **Plank variations** - Core staple for home workouts
5. **Minimal equipment** - Just floor space + maybe chair
6. **AI personalization** - Apps guide workouts (trend for 2026)

**Key principles:**
- Progressive overload through: harder variations, more reps, less rest
- Full ROM (range of motion) crucial without weights
- Tempo control (slow eccentric) increases difficulty
- Circuits keep heart rate up (cardio + strength)

## WORKOUT 1: FULL BODY (Complete home workout)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - fundamental patterns)
**Philosophy:** Learn basic bodyweight movements
1. **Air Squat** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Lower body push pattern
2. **Push-Up** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Upper body push (can do on knees)
3. **Plank** (3 sets x 30 seconds) - Core stability

**Why this works:** Research shows beginners need: 1 lower + 1 upper + 1 core. Air squats teach squat pattern. Push-ups (or knee push-ups) build upper body. Planks develop core foundation. This is the EXACT structure from Nerd Fitness beginner program.

**Home workout tip:** No equipment needed. 20-minute workout. Can do anywhere.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete body stimulus)
**Philosophy:** Add complexity and volume
1. **Jump Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Explosive lower body
2. **Push-Up** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Upper push (full ROM)
3. **Inverted Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper pull (use table/bar)
4. **Static Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral lower
5. **Mountain Climber** (4 sets x 30 seconds) - Core + cardio

**Why this works:** Popular home circuits use: explosive movement (jump squat) + push + pull + unilateral + core/cardio finisher. Inverted rows can be done under a table. Mountain climbers add cardio element. This is 2026 circuit training format.

**Home workout tip:** Use sturdy table for rows. 30-min workout.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - high-intensity calisthenics)
**Philosophy:** Maximum bodyweight challenge
1. **Pistol Squat** (4 sets x 8 reps per leg) - Advanced single-leg strength
2. **Decline Push-Up** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Harder push angle (feet elevated)
3. **Pull-Up** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Upper pull mastery
4. **Jumping Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Explosive unilateral
5. **Burpee** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Full body explosive
6. **Mountain Climber** (4 sets x 40 seconds) - Core + conditioning
7. **Plank** (4 sets x 60 seconds) - Core endurance

**Why this works:** Advanced calisthenics = hardest bodyweight variations. Pistol squats are elite leg exercise. Decline push-ups increase difficulty. Pull-ups require bar but are king of bodyweight pulling. Burpees for conditioning. This is 28-day calisthenics challenge level.

**Home workout tip:** Need pull-up bar. 40-45 min high-intensity session.

---

## WORKOUT 2: BALANCED UPPER BODY (Push + Pull focus)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - upper body foundation)
**Philosophy:** Equal push and pull
1. **Incline Push-Up** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Easier push angle (hands elevated)
2. **Inverted Row** (3 sets x 10 reps) - Horizontal pull (table)
3. **Plank** (3 sets x 30 seconds) - Core stability

**Why this works:** Home upper body needs push + pull balance. Incline push-ups (hands on chair/counter) easier for beginners. Inverted rows under table. Planks for core. This prevents shoulder imbalances.

**Home workout tip:** Use chair for incline push-ups, sturdy table for rows.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete upper development)
**Philosophy:** Multiple angles for push/pull
