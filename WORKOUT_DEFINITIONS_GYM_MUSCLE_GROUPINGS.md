# GYM MUSCLE GROUPINGS - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on 2026 fitness research from:
- Muscle & Strength PPL programs
- Built With Science full-body protocols
- Bret Contreras glute training science
- Women's Health + Legion Athletics training guides

**Key Principles:**
1. **Supersets work**: Train opposing muscles together (push/pull) for efficiency
2. **Compound movements first**: Always start with heavy compounds
3. **Balance front/back**: Prevent imbalances and injuries
4. **Progressive overload**: Add weight/reps every session
5. **Optimal frequency**: Train each muscle 2x/week for max growth

---

## 1. UPPER BODY (Chest + Back + Shoulders)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - foundational upper body)
**Philosophy:** Big compound movements, build base strength
1. **Push-Ups** (3x12) - Horizontal push, chest + front delts + triceps
2. **Lat Pulldown** (3x12) - Vertical pull, lats + biceps
3. **Seated Dumbbell Press** (3x12) - Overhead push, shoulders

**Why this works:** Research shows beginners need full-body compound movements. This hits all upper body pushing (chest/shoulders) and pulling (back) in ONE workout. Time-efficient and balanced.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete upper development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of horizontal/vertical push + pull, add isolation
1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4x10) - Horizontal push, chest dominant
2. **Dumbbell Row** (4x10) - Horizontal pull, mid-back thickness
3. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Vertical push, shoulders
4. **Assisted Pull-Up** (4x10) - Vertical pull, lat width
5. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4x10) - Side delt isolation

**Why this works:** Science proves training BOTH pushing and pulling in same session prevents imbalances. This is the exact structure used in all "upper body" programs: 2 presses + 2 pulls + 1 isolation.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum upper body mass)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + volume isolation, all angles
1. **Barbell Bench Press** (4x8) - Heavy horizontal push, chest
2. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (4x8) - Heavy horizontal pull, back
3. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4x8) - Heavy vertical push, shoulders
4. **Pull-Up** (4x8) - Vertical pull, lats
5. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4x8) - Upper chest
6. **Cable Crossover** (4x10) - Chest isolation
7. **Rear Delt Fly** (4x10) - Balance rear delts (prevent injury)

**Why this works:** Every top program uses this structure: alternate push/pull exercises to allow recovery. Heavy barbells build mass, then isolation adds detail. Rear delt work prevents shoulder issues from all the pressing.

---

## 2. LOWER BODY (Legs + Glutes)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - foundational leg training)
**Philosophy:** Learn squat and hinge patterns safely
1. **Goblet Squat** (3x12) - Squat pattern, quad + glute development
2. **Dumbbell RDL** (3x12) - Hinge pattern, hamstrings + glutes
3. **Leg Press** (3x12) - Quad mass builder, safer loading

**Why this works:** All lower body programs start with squats + hinges. Goblet squat teaches upright torso. RDL teaches hip hinge. Leg press allows progressive overload safely. Foundation = built.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - balanced leg development)
**Philosophy:** Squat + hinge + lunge + isolation
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4x10) - King of legs, quad + glute mass
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hip hinge, hamstrings + glutes
3. **Walking Lunge** (4x10) - Unilateral strength, prevents imbalances
4. **Leg Extension** (4x10) - Quad isolation
5. **Lying Leg Curl** (4x10) - Hamstring isolation

**Why this works:** Research shows balanced leg training needs: bilateral squat + hinge + unilateral work + isolation. This hits EVERYTHING: quads (squat, extension), hamstrings (RDL, curl), glutes (squat, RDL, lunges).

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - complete leg domination)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + unilateral + isolation + calves
1. **Front Squat** (4x8) - Advanced squat, quad emphasis
2. **Deficit Deadlift** (4x8) - Increased ROM, hamstring + glute builder
3. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4x8) - Hardest unilateral, quad + glute mass
4. **Hack Squat** (4x8) - Machine quad overload
5. **Nordic Curl** (4x8) - Elite hamstring builder (science-backed)
6. **Sissy Squat** (4x10) - Advanced quad isolation
7. **Standing Calf Raise** (4x15) - Complete lower body

**Why this works:** Front squats + deficit deads = maximum posterior chain development. Bulgarian split squats are proven most effective unilateral exercise. Nordic curls are THE best hamstring exercise (EMG studies). This is elite-level programming.

---

## 3. PUSH DAY (Chest + Shoulders + Triceps)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - learn pushing patterns)
**Philosophy:** Master horizontal + vertical push
1. **Push-Ups** (3x12) - Horizontal push foundation
2. **Seated Dumbbell Press** (3x12) - Vertical push, shoulders
3. **Cable Pushdown** (3x12) - Tricep isolation

**Why this works:** PPL research shows push day = all pressing muscles together. Push-ups build base, overhead press hits shoulders, tricep work finishes arms. Simple and effective.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete push development)
**Philosophy:** Heavy pressing + isolation for all three push muscles
1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4x10) - Chest compound
2. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Shoulder compound
3. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Upper chest emphasis
4. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4x10) - Side delt isolation
5. **Overhead Tricep Extension** (4x10) - Tricep long head (adds arm size)

**Why this works:** This is the EXACT structure from all PPL programs: 2 chest movements (flat + incline), 1 shoulder press, 1 lateral raise, 1 tricep. Hits all push muscles thoroughly.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum push development)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + high-volume isolation
1. **Barbell Bench Press** (4x8) - King of chest, maximum load
2. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4x8) - Best shoulder mass builder
3. **Incline Barbell Press** (4x8) - Heavy upper chest work
4. **Weighted Dip** (4x8) - Best compound for chest + triceps
5. **Leaning Lateral Raise** (4x8) - Advanced side delt overload
6. **Cable Crossover** (4x10) - Chest isolation, peak contraction
7. **Skull Crusher** (4x10) - Best tricep mass exercise

**Why this works:** All elite push programs use this: heavy barbell pressing (bench + OHP) + dips (compound), then isolation (lateral raises, flyes, tricep). Weighted dips are legendary for chest + tricep development.

---

## 4. PULL DAY (Back + Biceps + Rear Delts)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - learn pulling patterns)
**Philosophy:** Master vertical + horizontal pull
1. **Lat Pulldown** (3x12) - Vertical pull, lat development
2. **Seated Cable Row** (3x12) - Horizontal pull, mid-back
3. **Cable Bicep Curl** (3x12) - Bicep isolation

**Why this works:** All pull programs need: 1 vertical pull (lats) + 1 horizontal pull (mid-back) + arm work. This teaches proper pulling mechanics safely.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete pull development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of vertical/horizontal pulls + hinge + arms
1. **Assisted Pull-Up** (4x10) - Vertical pull, working toward full pull-up
2. **Dumbbell Row** (4x10) - Horizontal pull, mid-back mass
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hip hinge, lower back + hamstrings
4. **Reverse Fly** (4x10) - Rear delt health (prevents shoulder issues)
5. **Dumbbell Bicep Curl** (4x10) - Bicep mass

**Why this works:** PPL science shows optimal pull day = 2 pulling movements + 1 hinge + rear delts + biceps. RDL here develops posterior chain. This is the standard intermediate pull template.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - complete pulling domination)
**Philosophy:** Heavy deadlifts + multiple pull variations + arm volume
1. **Conventional Deadlift** (4x8) - King of back, total posterior chain
2. **Pull-Up** (4x8) - Bodyweight vertical pull mastery
3. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (4x8) - Heavy horizontal pull, thick back
4. **Weighted Pull-Up** (4x8) - Advanced lat overload
5. **T-Bar Row** (4x8) - Mid-back thickness (bodybuilding staple)
6. **Rear Delt Fly** (4x10) - Rear delt isolation
7. **Barbell Bicep Curl** (4x10) - Heavy bicep work

**Why this works:** This is textbook advanced PPL pull day: deadlifts + 2-3 pull-up variations + 2 row variations + rear delts + biceps. Covers all back functions: width (pull-ups), thickness (rows), strength (deadlifts).

---

## 5. FULL BODY (Everything in one workout)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - total body foundations)
**Philosophy:** One exercise per major movement pattern
1. **Goblet Squat** (3x12) - Lower body squat pattern
2. **Push-Ups** (3x12) - Upper body push pattern
3. **Lat Pulldown** (3x12) - Upper body pull pattern

**Why this works:** Built With Science proves best full-body = 1 lower push + 1 upper push + 1 upper pull. This trains EVERYTHING in 3 exercises. Perfect for beginners or 3x/week training.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete full-body development)
**Philosophy:** Hit all major muscle groups with compounds
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4x10) - Lower body compound, legs + glutes
2. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4x10) - Upper push, chest + shoulders + triceps
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hip hinge, hamstrings + glutes + back
4. **Dumbbell Row** (4x10) - Upper pull, back + biceps
5. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Shoulders

**Why this works:** Research shows optimal full-body = 2 lower (squat + hinge) + 2 upper push + 1 upper pull. This structure hits EVERY major muscle. Used in all 3-day split programs.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum full-body stimulus)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds for all major patterns + core
1. **Front Squat** (4x8) - Advanced squat, quad dominant
2. **Conventional Deadlift** (4x8) - Total posterior chain
3. **Barbell Bench Press** (4x8) - Heavy chest pressing
4. **Pull-Up** (4x8) - Back + biceps
5. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4x8) - Heavy shoulder work
6. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4x8) - Unilateral leg work
7. **Hanging Leg Raise** (4x8) - Core + grip

**Why this works:** This is ELITE full-body programming: squat + deadlift + bench + pull-ups + OHP = the "big 5" that all strength programs use. Added Bulgarian split squats (unilateral) and hanging leg raises (core) for completeness.

---

## 6. GLUTES & LEGS (Women's lower body specialization)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - glute activation basics)
**Philosophy:** Learn glute activation + basic leg work
1. **Glute Bridge** (3x12) - Hip thrust pattern, glute activation
2. **Goblet Squat** (3x12) - Squat pattern, quad + glute
3. **Reverse Lunge** (3x12) - Lunge pattern, glute emphasis

**Why this works:** Bret Contreras research shows beginners need: hip thrusts (glute activation) + squats (quad/glute) + lunges (unilateral glute work). This is the foundation of ALL glute programs.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete glute development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of hip thrust + squat + hinge + isolation
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4x10) - Advanced hip thrust, glute isolation
2. **Barbell Back Squat** (4x10) - Bilateral squat, quad + glute
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hip hinge, hamstring + glute lengthening
4. **Curtsy Lunge** (4x10) - Glute medius emphasis (side glute)
5. **Sumo Squat** (4x10) - Wide stance, inner thigh + glute

**Why this works:** Science shows optimal glute training needs: thrust pattern (activation) + squat (load) + hinge (stretch) + lunges (unilateral). Curtsy lunges + sumo squats hit glute medius (creates that "shelf" look).

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum glute + leg development)
**Philosophy:** Heavy hip thrusts + compounds + advanced isolation
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4x8) - Advanced hip thrust with extended ROM
2. **Front Squat** (4x8) - Quad emphasis, maintains glute
3. **Deficit Deadlift** (4x8) - Maximum hamstring + glute stretch
4. **Pulse Curtsy Lunge** (4x8) - Advanced glute medius work
5. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4x8) - Hardest unilateral, glute dominant
6. **Sumo Squat Hold Pulse** (4x10) - Time under tension, glute burn
7. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4x10) - Isolation glute finisher

**Why this works:** This is EXACTLY what top glute coaches prescribe: elevated hip thrusts (proven most effective glute exercise) + front squats (quad work) + deficit deads (hamstring stretch = growth) + curtsy lunges (glute medius) + Bulgarian split squats (unilateral strength). Pulse movements at end create that "pump" all glute programs use.
