# HOME BOOTY - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS (WOMEN'S HOME GLUTE WORKOUTS)

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on VIRAL 2026 home booty trends:
- **MadFit** - "10 Min Booty Workout" (millions of views) - resistance band glute activation
- **"Get Thick Booty & Slim Waist"** - 17-min floor workout (viral YouTube)
- **Women's Health** - 7-min & 20-min bodyweight glute workouts
- **Laci Renee (TikTok)** - Side booty workouts (abductions, pulses, holds)
- **Resistance bands** - #1 home booty equipment (mini loop bands)

**WHAT WOMEN ACTUALLY DO AT HOME FOR GLUTES:**
1. **Resistance/mini bands** - MOST POPULAR home booty tool
2. **Floor exercises** - Donkey kicks, frog pumps, glute bridges
3. **No squats** - Many prefer glute isolation over compound squats
4. **Short duration** - 10-20 min workouts (time-efficient)
5. **Glute activation focus** - Mind-muscle connection emphasized
6. **Pulse techniques** - Constant tension at top of movement

**KEY DIFFERENCES FROM GYM BOOTY:**
- No heavy weights = HIGH REPS (15-20+)
- More isolation = less compound movements
- Resistance bands = constant tension
- Floor work = safe, accessible
- Pulse reps = time under tension without weight

## WORKOUT 1: GLUTE ACTIVATION
**Focus:** Wake up the glutes, mind-muscle connection

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - bodyweight only)
**Philosophy:** Learn basic glute activation patterns
1. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 20 reps) - Basic hip thrust, squeeze at top
2. **Standing Glute Kickback** (3 sets x 15 reps per side) - Basic kickback pattern
3. **Frog Pump** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Hip thrust variation, feet together

**Why this works:** Women's Health 7-min workout uses this structure. Glute bridges = foundation. Standing kickbacks teach hip extension. Frog pumps = viral Instagram finisher. HIGH reps compensate for no weight.

**Home booty tip:** Focus on SQUEEZE at top. Mind-muscle connection > speed.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - add resistance band)
**Philosophy:** Resistance band for constant tension
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Unilateral hip thrust
2. **Donkey Kick** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Kick heel to ceiling, squeeze glute
3. **Standing Glute Kickback** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Standing hip extension
4. **Frog Pump** (4 sets x 20 reps) - Feet together, knees out, hip thrust
5. **Quadruped Hip Extension** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Straight leg hip extension

**Why this works:** This is EXACTLY what MadFit's "10 Min Booty Workout" uses! Donkey kicks = Instagram famous. Single-leg bridges = unilateral work. Quadruped hip extension = straight leg version (different angle). Frog pumps = high-rep finisher.

**Home booty tip:** Mini loop band above knees. HIGH reps (15-20). 10-12 min workout.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - pulse techniques + bands)
**Philosophy:** Maximum glute activation with pulses
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Feet elevated, increased ROM
2. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Hold heel high, pulse
3. **Standing Glute Kickback** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Full range kickback
4. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Glute medius (side glute)
5. **Frog Pump Pulse** (4 sets x 25 reps) - Hold + pulse = constant tension
6. **Quadruped Hip Extension Pulse** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Pulse at top
7. **Single Leg RDL** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Balance + hamstring/glute stretch

**Why this works:** Pulse techniques = TikTok viral (Laci Renee). Elevated bridges = more ROM. Donkey kick pulses = constant tension. Curtsy lunges hit glute medius (side glute). Frog pump pulses = ultra-popular finisher.

**Home booty tip:** Band makes it BURN. 20 min workout. Pulse at top = constant tension.

---

## WORKOUT 2: BOOTY BURNER
**Focus:** High-volume glute workout, maximum pump

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - bodyweight, high reps)
**Philosophy:** Volume compensates for no weight
1. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 25 reps) - High-rep hip thrust
2. **Sumo Squat** (3 sets x 20 reps) - Wide stance, glute emphasis
3. **Reverse Lunge** (3 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Forward lean for glutes

**Why this works:** "Booty burner" = HIGH VOLUME. 25 reps on bridges = pump. Sumo squats hit glutes + inner thighs. Reverse lunges with forward lean = glute activation. This builds endurance + pump.

**Home booty tip:** SLOW tempo (3 seconds down). Feel the burn!

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - band + high volume)
**Philosophy:** Resistance band + HIGH reps = burn
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Unilateral volume
2. **Sumo Squat** (4 sets x 20 reps) - Band above knees for resistance
3. **Reverse Lunge** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Forward lean
4. **Donkey Kick** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - High-rep isolation
5. **Frog Pump** (4 sets x 25 reps) - High-rep pump finisher

**Why this works:** This is the "20 Min Booty Burn" structure from viral YouTube videos. Mix of unilateral (single-leg bridges, lunges) + isolation (donkey kicks) + high-rep finisher (frog pumps). Band adds resistance.

**Home booty tip:** 20 reps minimum. Rest 30-45 seconds. Keep moving = pump!

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - burnout protocol)
**Philosophy:** Maximum volume + pulse + holds
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 20 reps) - High-volume with ROM
2. **Sumo Squat Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps) - Hold bottom, pulse 20x
3. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Glute medius emphasis
4. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4 sets x 25 reps per side) - Ultra high-rep + pulse
5. **Frog Pump Pulse** (4 sets x 30 reps) - Hold + pulse = constant tension
6. **Standing Glute Kickback** (4 sets x 25 reps per side) - Volume kickback
7. **Quadruped Hip Extension Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Pulse finisher

**Why this works:** This is BRUTAL. Every exercise includes pulses or ultra high reps (25-30). Curtsy lunges for side glute. Frog pumps 30 reps = insane pump. This is what creates that "booty burn" feeling women want.

**Home booty tip:** Minimal rest (30 sec). Band on EVERYTHING. 25+ min workout.

---

## WORKOUT 3: BAND BOOTY
**Focus:** Resistance band emphasis, constant tension

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - mini band basics)
**Philosophy:** Learn band positioning and tension
1. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 20 reps) - Band above knees, push knees out
2. **Sumo Squat** (3 sets x 20 reps) - Band above knees, wide stance
3. **Standing Glute Kickback** (3 sets x 15 reps per side) - Band creates resistance

**Why this works:** All exercises use mini loop band above knees. This is BEGINNER-FRIENDLY band work. Focus on maintaining tension (knees pushing out against band). These are the 3 most common banded exercises.

**Home booty tip:** Mini loop band (fabric, not latex). Place just above knees.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - full band workout)
**Philosophy:** Band on everything, constant tension
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Band above knees, one leg
2. **Sumo Squat** (4 sets x 20 reps) - Band above knees, squat + push out
3. **Donkey Kick** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Band around feet or above knees
4. **Standing Glute Kickback** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Band resistance
5. **Frog Pump** (4 sets x 25 reps) - Band above knees, feet together

**Why this works:** This is the "10 Min Resistance Band Booty" format (MadFit: millions of views). Band on EVERY exercise = constant tension throughout workout. Donkey kicks + kickbacks = most popular isolation moves. This is exactly what's viral!

**Home booty tip:** 10-15 min. Band never comes off. Burn is REAL.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - band + pulse + holds)
**Philosophy:** Maximum band tension + advanced techniques
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Band above knees + feet elevated
2. **Sumo Squat Hold Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps + 10 sec hold) - Squat + hold + pulse
3. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Band above knees
4. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Band + pulse at top
5. **Frog Pump Pulse** (4 sets x 25 reps) - Band above knees + pulse
6. **Quadruped Hip Extension Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Band + pulse
7. **Single Leg RDL** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Balance + stretch

**Why this works:** Every exercise has band + pulse or hold. Curtsy lunges with band = glute medius destroyer. Holds at bottom of squat = isometric strength. This combines band resistance + pulse techniques + holds = TRIPLE STIMULUS.

**Home booty tip:** Heavy band. 20+ min. Most advanced home booty workout.
