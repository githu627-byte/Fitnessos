## WORKOUT 1: 10 MIN QUICK BURN
**Focus:** Maximum results in minimum time (most popular format)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest, 2 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Learn HIIT basics with manageable intensity
1. **Marching In Place** (30s work / 30s rest) - Cardio warm-up
2. **Squat Reach** (30s work / 30s rest) - Lower body (squat without jump)
3. **Incline Push-Up** (30s work / 30s rest) - Upper body (hands elevated)
4. **Standing Oblique Crunch** (30s work / 30s rest) - Core engagement

**Repeat 2 rounds = 8 minutes + warm-up/cool-down = 10 min**

**Why this works:** Kaiser Permanente 10-min HIIT uses this exact structure. Beginners need 1:1 work:rest ratio. Low-impact versions (no jumping) prevent injury. This teaches interval training basics.

**YouTube proof:** Chloe Ting's "No Jumping HIIT" has 461K views - people want low-impact!

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest, 2 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Increase intensity, add explosive movements
1. **High Knee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio burst
2. **Jump Squat** (40s work / 20s rest) - Explosive lower body
3. **Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Upper body push
4. **Mountain Climber** (40s work / 20s rest) - Core + cardio
5. **Butt Kick** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio recovery
6. **Burpee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Full body finisher

**Repeat 2 rounds = 12 minutes total**

**Why this works:** This is the EXACT structure from viral YouTube HIIT workouts. 40:20 ratio = proven fat burning. Mix of explosive (jump squats, burpees) + cardio (high knees, butt kicks) + core (mountain climbers). This is what gets MILLIONS of views.

**YouTube proof:** Chloe Ting's "20 Min Cardio" has 3M views using this format!

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest, 2 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Maximum intensity, Tabata-inspired
1. **High Knee Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum cardio intensity
2. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Full body explosive
3. **Tuck Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum lower power
4. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced core
5. **Star Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive cardio
6. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Second burpee round
7. **Butt Kick Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - High-intensity cardio
8. **Mountain Climber** (45s work / 15s rest) - Core finisher

**Repeat 2 rounds = ~16 minutes**

**Why this works:** 45:15 ratio = ELITE HIIT (close to Tabata intensity). Double burpees = maximum calorie burn. Tuck jumps + star jumps = plyometric power. This is "Killer HIIT" level (Chloe Ting: 538K views).

**Science:** This intensity triggers maximum EPOC (afterburn effect).

---

## WORKOUT 2: 20 MIN DESTROYER
**Focus:** Most popular HIIT duration (YouTube gold standard)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Build endurance with moderate intensity
1. **Step Touch** (30s work / 30s rest) - Light cardio
2. **Squat Reach** (30s work / 30s rest) - Lower body
3. **Knee Push-Up** (30s work / 30s rest) - Upper body (modified)
4. **Plank Tap** (30s work / 30s rest) - Core stability

**3 rounds = 12 minutes + warm-up/cool-down = ~15-18 min**

**Why this works:** Beginners need MORE rest. 1:1 ratio allows completing full 20 minutes without burnout. Modified movements (knee push-ups, no jumping) prevent injury while building base.

**YouTube proof:** "Beginner HIIT" videos use this exact format.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Balanced intensity for fat burning
1. **Jumping Jack** (40s work / 20s rest) - Classic cardio
2. **Jump Squat** (40s work / 20s rest) - Explosive lower
3. **Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Upper body
4. **Mountain Climber** (40s work / 20s rest) - Core + cardio
5. **High Knee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio burst
6. **Burpee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Full body finisher

**3 rounds = 18 minutes + warm-up/cool-down = 20 min**

**Why this works:** This is THE STANDARD YouTube HIIT format. Jumping jacks → jump squats → push-ups → mountain climbers → high knees → burpees = most popular exercise order. 40:20 ratio = optimal fat burning.

**YouTube proof:** Chloe Ting's "20 Min Cardio" (3M views) uses almost this EXACT workout!

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Maximum calorie burn, elite conditioning
1. **Star Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive plyometric
2. **Burpee Tuck Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced burpee
3. **Tuck Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum power
4. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (45s work / 15s rest) - Dynamic core
5. **High Knee Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum cardio
6. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Full body
7. **Skater Hop** (45s work / 15s rest) - Lateral power
8. **Burpee Sprawl** (45s work / 15s rest) - Advanced finisher

**3 rounds = 24 minutes (includes transition time)**

**Why this works:** This is "Killer HIIT" or "Intense HIIT" level. Triple burpee variations (regular, tuck jump, sprawl) = maximum intensity. Plyometrics throughout (star jump, tuck jump, skater hop) = elite conditioning.

**YouTube proof:** Chloe Ting's "Intense Standing HIIT" (808K views) uses this intensity!

**Science:** Burns 400+ calories in 20 minutes + afterburn effect.

---

## WORKOUT 3: TABATA TORTURE
**Focus:** Authentic Tabata protocol (20s work / 10s rest × 8 = 4 min per exercise)

### BEGINNER (2 exercises - 8 rounds each = 8 min total)
**Philosophy:** Learn Tabata format with simple movements
1. **Marching In Place** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)
   - Rest 1 minute
2. **Squat Reach** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)

**Total: ~10 minutes with rest**

**Why this works:** TRUE Tabata = 20s:10s ratio. Beginners do 2 simple exercises (one cardio, one lower body). 8 rounds = authentic protocol. Research shows even beginners benefit from Tabata structure.

**Science:** Dr. Izumi Tabata's research: 14% aerobic + 28% anaerobic capacity gains!

---

### INTERMEDIATE (4 exercises - 8 rounds each = 16 min total)
**Philosophy:** Multiple exercises in Tabata format
1. **Jumping Jack** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)
   - Rest 1 minute
2. **Jump Squat** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)
   - Rest 1 minute
3. **Mountain Climber** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)
   - Rest 1 minute
4. **Burpee** (20s work / 10s rest × 8 rounds = 4 min)

**Total: ~20 minutes with rest periods**

**Why this works:** This is AUTHENTIC Tabata with variety. Each exercise gets full 4-minute protocol. Progression: cardio → lower explosive → core → full body. This is BRUTAL but effective.

**YouTube proof:** "Tabata Workout" videos use this exact structure!

**Science:** 20s:10s ratio = 170% VO2 max intensity (original research protocol).

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 4 rounds each = 16 min working time)
**Philosophy:** Elite Tabata with maximum variety
1. **Star Jump** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
2. **Burpee Tuck Jump** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
3. **High Knee Sprint** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
4. **Tuck Jump** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
5. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
6. **Burpee** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
7. **Skater Hop** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)
8. **Burpee Sprawl** (20s work / 10s rest × 4 rounds)

**Total: ~20 minutes (4 rounds each = faster pace)**

**Why this works:** Advanced Tabata = MORE exercises, FEWER rounds each (keeps variety high, prevents failure). All plyometric movements. Triple burpee variations. This is INSANE intensity.

**Science:** This generates MAXIMUM EPOC (afterburn effect lasting 24+ hours).

## WORKOUT 4: CARDIO BLAST
**Focus:** Pure cardio conditioning (no strength, just cardio movements)

### BEGINNER (4 exercises - 30s work / 30s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Low-impact cardio conditioning
1. **Marching In Place** (30s work / 30s rest) - Basic cardio
2. **Step Touch** (30s work / 30s rest) - Lateral movement
3. **Knee Tap** (30s work / 30s rest) - Low-impact cardio
4. **Standing Oblique Crunch** (30s work / 30s rest) - Standing core

**3 rounds = ~12 minutes + warm-up/cool-down = 15-18 min**

**Why this works:** Pure low-impact cardio for beginners. No jumping = joint-friendly. All standing movements = accessible. This builds cardiovascular base without injury risk.

**YouTube proof:** Chloe Ting's "No Jumping HIIT" (461K views) proves demand!

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 exercises - 40s work / 20s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Classic cardio movements, moderate intensity
1. **Jumping Jack** (40s work / 20s rest) - Classic cardio
2. **High Knee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Cardio burst
3. **Butt Kick** (40s work / 20s rest) - Hamstring cardio
4. **Lateral Shuffle** (40s work / 20s rest) - Lateral movement
5. **Mountain Climber** (40s work / 20s rest) - Core + cardio
6. **Jumping Jack** (40s work / 20s rest) - Finish strong

**3 rounds = 18 minutes + warm-up = 20 min**

**Why this works:** PURE cardio movements (no push-ups, no squats - just cardio). This is what people want for "cardio blast" - keep moving, keep heart rate up. Double jumping jacks (start + finish) = bookend structure.

**YouTube proof:** "Cardio HIIT" videos use only cardio moves like this!

---

### ADVANCED (8 exercises - 45s work / 15s rest, 3 rounds)
**Philosophy:** Maximum cardio intensity, plyometric focus
1. **Star Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive cardio
2. **High Knee Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Maximum intensity
3. **Butt Kick Sprint** (45s work / 15s rest) - Fast hamstring cardio
4. **Tuck Jump** (45s work / 15s rest) - Explosive power
5. **Skater Hop** (45s work / 15s rest) - Lateral plyometric
6. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (45s work / 15s rest) - Dynamic core
7. **Burpee** (45s work / 15s rest) - Full body cardio
8. **Jumping Jack** (45s work / 15s rest) - Classic finisher
