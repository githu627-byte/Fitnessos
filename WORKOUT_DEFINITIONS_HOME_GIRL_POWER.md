## WORKOUT 1: GLUTE SCULPT (Home booty + lower body focus)
**Focus:** Lower body emphasis with glute specialization

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - bodyweight lower body)
**Philosophy:** Build lower body foundation
1. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 20 reps) - Hip thrust foundation
2. **Sumo Squat** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Wide stance lower body
3. **Reverse Lunge** (3 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Unilateral leg work

**Why this works:** Women at home prioritize lower body. Glute bridges = foundation. Sumo squats = wide stance (glute emphasis). Reverse lunges = unilateral work. This is beginner-friendly lower body focus.

**Home workout tip:** 15-20 min. No equipment. Can do daily.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - full lower body + core)
**Philosophy:** Complete lower body development
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps per side) - Unilateral hip thrust
2. **Jump Squat** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Explosive lower power
3. **Walking Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Dynamic unilateral
4. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute medius (side glute)
5. **Mountain Climber** (4 sets x 30 seconds) - Core + cardio

**Why this works:** Chloe Ting programs use this structure: glute work + explosive (jump squat) + lunges (2 variations) + core finisher. This hits glutes from ALL angles. Mountain climbers add cardio element.

**Home workout tip:** 25-30 min. Add mini band for extra burn.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum lower body volume)
**Philosophy:** Elite lower body development
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Increased ROM
2. **Jump Squat** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Explosive power
3. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Glute medius
4. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4 sets x 20 reps per side) - Isolation + pulse
5. **Jumping Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Explosive unilateral
6. **Frog Pump Pulse** (4 sets x 25 reps) - High-rep glute finisher
7. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (4 sets x 40 seconds) - Advanced core

**Why this works:** This is KILLER lower body. Elevated bridges + 2 lunge variations + donkey kicks + frog pumps + explosive work (jump squats, jumping lunges). This is what advanced Chloe Ting challenges use.

**Home workout tip:** 35-40 min. Advanced only. Maximum lower volume.

---

## WORKOUT 2: UPPER/LOWER SPLIT - UPPER BODY (Home upper body for women)
**Focus:** Toned arms, shoulders, back (no chest focus)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - basic upper body)
**Philosophy:** Learn fundamental upper body patterns
1. **Incline Push-Up** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Easier push angle (hands elevated on chair)
2. **Inverted Row** (3 sets x 10 reps) - Horizontal pull (under table)
3. **Plank** (3 sets x 30 seconds) - Core stability

**Why this works:** Women's upper body at home = modified push-ups (incline easier) + pulling (rows under table) + core (plank). This builds foundation for toned arms without heavy weights.

**Home workout tip:** Use chair for incline push-ups, sturdy table for rows. 15-20 min.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete upper body)
**Philosophy:** Arms + shoulders + back development
1. **Push-Up** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Standard horizontal push
2. **Diamond Push-Up** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Tricep emphasis (hands together)
3. **Inverted Row** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Back work
4. **Plank Tap** (4 sets x 20 reps) - Dynamic plank, shoulder stability
5. **Mountain Climber** (4 sets x 30 seconds) - Core + cardio finisher

**Why this works:** Rowan Row's 3.4M view video uses this structure: 2 push variations + rows + dynamic plank + cardio finisher. This hits arms (push-ups = triceps, rows = biceps), shoulders (plank taps), core (mountain climbers).

**Home workout tip:** 25-30 min. No equipment or just table.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum upper body definition)
**Philosophy:** Toned arms + shoulder definition + back
1. **Decline Push-Up** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Feet elevated (harder angle)
2. **Diamond Push-Up** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Tricep isolation
3. **Archer Push-Up** (4 sets x 8 reps per side) - Single-arm progression
4. **Inverted Row** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Back volume
5. **Plank Jack** (4 sets x 30 reps) - Dynamic core
6. **Mountain Climber Crossover** (4 sets x 40 seconds) - Oblique work
7. **Burpee** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Full body finisher

**Why this works:** Advanced push-up variations (decline, diamond, archer) = arm definition without weights. High-rep rows for back. Dynamic core (plank jacks, mountain climbers). Burpees = conditioning. This is elite home upper body.

**Home workout tip:** 35-40 min. Pull-up bar optional but adds value.

---

## WORKOUT 3: FULL BODY (Most popular format - Chloe Ting structure)
**Focus:** Complete body in one session (most common women's home workout)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - full body basics)
**Philosophy:** Hit all major muscle groups
1. **Air Squat** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Lower body
2. **Incline Push-Up** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Upper body push
3. **Mountain Climber** (3 sets x 30 seconds) - Core + cardio

**Why this works:** Full body = 1 lower + 1 upper + 1 core/cardio. This is the MINIMUM effective dose. Chloe Ting beginner videos use this exact structure. Simple, effective, doable.

**Home workout tip:** 15 min. Can do 5-6 days per week. Perfect for beginners.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete full body, 40s:20s format)
**Philosophy:** Balanced full body with cardio elements
1. **Jump Squat** (40s work / 20s rest × 4 rounds) - Explosive lower
2. **Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest × 4 rounds) - Upper push
3. **Inverted Row** (40s work / 20s rest × 4 rounds) - Upper pull
4. **Glute Bridge** (40s work / 20s rest × 4 rounds) - Glute isolation
5. **Burpee** (40s work / 20s rest × 4 rounds) - Full body cardio finisher

**Why this works:** This is THE VIRAL FORMAT! 40s work / 20s rest = Rowan Row (3.4M views), MadFit (millions), Chloe Ting structure. 4 rounds = ~20 min total. Hits everything: legs, chest/triceps, back/biceps, glutes, cardio.

**Home workout tip:** 20-25 min. This is the MOST POPULAR women's home workout format!

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum full body intensity, no repeat)
**Philosophy:** High-volume full body, circuit style
1. **Tuck Jump** (40s work / 20s rest) - Maximum lower power
2. **Decline Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Advanced upper push
3. **Inverted Row** (40s work / 20s rest) - Back work

5. **Diamond Push-Up** (40s work / 20s rest) - Tricep focus
6. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (40s work / 20s rest per side) - Unilateral glute
7. **Burpee** (40s work / 20s rest) - Full body finisher

**3 rounds = 30+ min total**

**Why this works:** "No repeat" structure = Rowan Row's viral format. Every exercise hits different muscle/angle. Plyometrics (tuck jump, jumping lunge) + strength (push-ups, rows) + glutes (bridges) + conditioning (burpees). This is COMPLETE.

**Home workout tip:** 30-35 min. Advanced conditioning required.
