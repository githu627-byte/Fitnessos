# GYM MUSCLE SPLITS - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on 2026 fitness research from:
- Men's Journal "50 Best Chest Exercises"
- Barbell Medicine scientific analysis
- GymShark training guides
- Popular bodybuilding programs

**Key Principles:**
1. Compound movements FIRST (most bang for buck)
2. Train from multiple angles (flat, incline, decline for chest; vertical/horizontal pull for back)
3. Progressive overload with proper volume
4. Beginner: 3 sets x 12 reps | Intermediate: 4 sets x 10 reps | Advanced: 4 sets x 8 reps

## 1. CHEST WORKOUT

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - learning form, building base)
**Philosophy:** Start with stable movements, master technique
1. **Push-Ups** (3x12) - Foundation horizontal press, bodyweight control
2. **Incline Push-Ups** (3x12) - Upper chest activation, easier angle
3. **Cable Chest Fly** (3x12) - Constant tension, easier to control than dumbbells

**Why this works:** All research shows mastering push-up variations before loading barbell bench is critical for shoulder health and proper pressing mechanics.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - balanced development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of compound + isolation, multiple angles
1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4x10) - Compound horizontal press, unilateral control
2. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Upper chest focus (clavicular head)
3. **Decline Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Lower chest emphasis
4. **Dumbbell Chest Fly** (4x10) - Stretch + contraction, isolation
5. **Cable Chest Fly** (4x10) - Constant tension finisher

**Why this works:** Hits all 3 angles (flat/incline/decline) which research proves activates different muscle fibers for complete pec development. Dumbbells allow greater ROM than barbell.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum volume + intensity)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + advanced techniques
1. **Barbell Bench Press** (4x8) - King of chest exercises, maximum load
2. **Incline Barbell Press** (4x8) - Heavy upper chest compound
3. **Decline Barbell Press** (4x8) - Heavy lower chest compound  
4. **Cable Crossover** (4x8) - Advanced fly variation, peak contraction
5. **Dumbbell Chest Fly** (4x10) - Volume isolation work
6. **Cable Chest Fly** (4x10) - Pump finisher
7. **Push-Ups** (4x15) - Burnout set, complete muscle exhaustion

**Why this works:** Follows proven bodybuilding protocols: heavy barbell work for strength/mass, followed by flyes for stretch/pump, finished with burnout. All top programs use this structure.

---

## 2. BACK WORKOUT

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - build pulling strength)
**Philosophy:** Master basic pulling patterns safely
1. **Lat Pulldown** (3x12) - Vertical pull foundation, learn lat engagement
2. **Seated Cable Row** (3x12) - Horizontal pull, mid-back development
3. **Face Pull** (3x12) - Rear delt + upper back, posture work

**Why this works:** Research shows beginners need to develop back mind-muscle connection before pull-ups. These movements teach proper scapular retraction.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete back development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of vertical/horizontal pulls + deadlift progression
1. **Assisted Pull-Up** (4x10) - Working toward full pull-up, lat builder
2. **Dumbbell Row** (4x10) - Unilateral horizontal pull, mid-back mass
3. **Chin-Up** (4x10) - Supinated grip, bicep + lat involvement
4. **Chest Supported Row** (4x10) - Pure back isolation, no cheating
5. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hinge pattern, lower back + hamstrings

**Why this works:** Science shows 2 vertical pulls + 2 horizontal pulls = optimal back thickness + width. RDL teaches hinge before conventional deadlift.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - full spectrum back training)
**Philosophy:** Heavy deadlifts + advanced pulling + isolation
1. **Conventional Deadlift** (4x8) - King of back exercises, total posterior chain
2. **Pull-Up** (4x8) - Bodyweight vertical pull mastery
3. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (4x8) - Heavy horizontal pull, mid-back mass
4. **Weighted Pull-Up** (4x8) - Advanced lat development
5. **T-Bar Row** (4x8) - Thick back builder, popular in all programs
6. **Rear Delt Fly** (4x10) - Rear delt isolation
7. **Chin-Up** (4x10) - Volume finisher, bicep + lat pump

**Why this works:** Every elite back program includes deadlifts + pull-ups + heavy rows. This hits all back regions: lats (width), mid-back (thickness), lower back (strength).

---

## 3. SHOULDERS WORKOUT

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - foundational shoulder work)
**Philosophy:** Stable pressing + light isolation
1. **Seated Dumbbell Press** (3x12) - Supported overhead press, learn pattern
2. **Cable Lateral Raise** (3x12) - Side delt isolation, constant tension
3. **Face Pull** (3x12) - Rear delt + rotator cuff health

**Why this works:** Seated pressing reduces injury risk while learning. Research shows lateral raises + face pulls prevent shoulder imbalances.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - 3D shoulder development)
**Philosophy:** Overhead pressing + all three delt heads
1. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4x10) - Full overhead press, core stability
2. **Arnold Press** (4x10) - Rotation = all three delt heads activated
3. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4x10) - Side delt mass builder
4. **Dumbbell Front Raise** (4x10) - Front delt emphasis
5. **Rear Delt Fly** (4x10) - Rear delt isolation

**Why this works:** All experts agree: hit all three delt heads (front, side, rear) for balanced "cannonball" shoulders. Arnold press is iconic for a reason.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum shoulder development)
**Philosophy:** Heavy overhead work + high-volume isolation
1. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4x8) - Strongest overhead movement, most popular
2. **Push Press** (4x8) - Explosive overhead power, leg drive
3. **Leaning Lateral Raise** (4x8) - Advanced side delt overload
4. **Barbell Front Raise** (4x8) - Heavy front delt work
5. **Reverse Pec Deck** (4x10) - Machine rear delt isolation
6. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4x10) - Volume side delt work
7. **Rear Delt Fly** (4x10) - Finish rear delts

**Why this works:** Barbell OHP is the gold standard for shoulder mass (every program). Push press adds athletic power. High-volume raises create the "3D" look.

---

## 4. LEGS WORKOUT

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - learn squat/hinge patterns)
**Philosophy:** Master fundamental movement patterns
1. **Goblet Squat** (3x12) - Front-loaded squat, teaches upright torso
2. **Leg Press** (3x12) - Safer loading, build quad strength
3. **Dumbbell RDL** (3x12) - Learn hip hinge before heavy deadlifts

**Why this works:** Research shows goblet squats are THE best beginner squat variation. Leg press allows progressive overload safely.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete leg development)
**Philosophy:** Balanced quads + hamstrings + accessories
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4x10) - King of leg exercises, quad + glute mass
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4x10) - Hamstring + glute builder
3. **Walking Lunge** (4x10) - Unilateral strength, quad focus
4. **Hack Squat** (4x10) - Machine quad isolation
5. **Lying Leg Curl** (4x10) - Hamstring isolation

**Why this works:** Every leg program includes squats + RDLs. Lunges add unilateral work (prevents imbalances). Machine work allows failure safely.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum leg mass + strength)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + isolation + calves
1. **Front Squat** (4x8) - Advanced squat variation, quad emphasis
2. **Deficit Deadlift** (4x8) - Increased ROM, hamstring + back builder
3. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4x8) - Hardest unilateral movement, popular for quads
4. **Sissy Squat** (4x8) - Advanced quad isolation, knee-dominant
5. **Nordic Curl** (4x8) - Elite hamstring builder (science-backed)
6. **Spanish Squat** (4x10) - Advanced quad isolation technique
7. **Single Leg Calf Raise** (4x15) - Complete calf development

**Why this works:** Front squats are THE advanced squat (every athlete uses them). Nordic curls are proven most effective hamstring exercise. Bulgarian split squats are Instagram famous for a reason - they WORK.

---

## 5. ARMS WORKOUT (Biceps + Triceps)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - balanced arm development)
**Philosophy:** Cable work for constant tension, learn curl/extension patterns
1. **Cable Bicep Curl** (3x12) - Constant tension, easier than free weights
2. **Cable Pushdown** (3x12) - Tricep isolation, learn extension pattern
3. **Seated Hammer Curl** (3x12) - Brachialis development, seated = no swing

**Why this works:** Research shows cables provide constant tension = better muscle activation for beginners. Hammer curls hit brachialis (makes arms look thicker from side).

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete arm development)
**Philosophy:** Mix of biceps/triceps, multiple angles
1. **Dumbbell Bicep Curl** (4x10) - Classic bicep builder, free weight progression
2. **Overhead Tricep Extension** (4x10) - Long head tricep emphasis (makes arms look bigger)
3. **Standing Hammer Curl** (4x10) - Brachialis + forearm work
4. **Preacher Curl** (4x10) - Bicep isolation, removes momentum
5. **Dip Machine** (4x10) - Tricep mass builder

**Why this works:** Science shows overhead tricep work (long head) adds most arm mass. Preacher curls are legendary for bicep peaks. Mix of movements = complete development.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - maximum arm size)
**Philosophy:** Heavy compounds + high-volume isolation
1. **Barbell Bicep Curl** (4x8) - Heaviest bicep load, mass builder
2. **Skull Crusher** (4x8) - Best tricep mass exercise (research-backed)
3. **Cross Body Hammer Curl** (4x8) - Advanced brachialis overload
4. **Weighted Dip** (4x8) - Best compound tricep movement
5. **Spider Curl** (4x10) - Advanced bicep isolation, peak contraction
6. **JM Press** (4x10) - Powerlifting tricep builder
7. **Close Grip Bench Press** (4x10) - Heavy tricep compound finisher

**Why this works:** This is the exact structure used by every arm specialist program. Skull crushers + weighted dips = tricep mass. Barbell curls + spider curls = bicep peaks. Close grip bench is a powerlifting staple for arm strength.

---

## 6. CORE WORKOUT

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - anti-movement patterns)
**Philosophy:** Learn bracing, build foundation
1. **Crunch** (3x12) - Basic flexion, learn ab contraction
2. **Dead Bug** (3x12) - Anti-extension, core stability
3. **Pallof Press Kneeling** (3x12) - Anti-rotation, functional core

**Why this works:** Modern core training focuses on "anti-movement" (preventing unwanted motion). Dead bugs + pallof press are science-backed for injury prevention.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete core development)
**Philosophy:** All core functions (flexion, anti-extension, anti-rotation, lower abs, obliques)
1. **Cable Crunch** (4x10) - Loaded flexion, progressive overload
2. **Lying Leg Raise** (4x10) - Lower ab focus, hip flexor control
3. **Pallof Press Standing** (4x10) - Standing anti-rotation, harder than kneeling
4. **Russian Twist** (4x10) - Oblique rotation, popular ab exercise
5. **Side Plank** (4x10) - Lateral core stability, oblique isometric

**Why this works:** Hits all core regions: upper abs (cable crunch), lower abs (leg raises), obliques (twists + side plank), anti-rotation (pallof). This is the exact setup used in athletic training.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - elite core strength)
**Philosophy:** Advanced progressions + loaded movements
1. **Decline Weighted Sit-Up** (4x8) - Most advanced flexion exercise
2. **Hanging Leg Raise** (4x8) - Elite lower ab exercise (requires grip + core)
3. **Pallof Press Split Stance** (4x8) - Advanced anti-rotation
4. **Landmine Rotation** (4x8) - Explosive oblique work, athletic
5. **Russian Twist** (4x10) - Volume oblique work
6. **Lying Leg Raise** (4x10) - Volume lower ab work
7. **Cable Crunch** (4x12) - High-rep ab finisher, pump

**Why this works:** Hanging leg raises are THE gold standard advanced ab exercise (every athlete does them). Landmine rotations add rotational power. This workout would destroy anyone's core.
