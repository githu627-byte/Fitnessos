# GYM GIRL POWER - PERFECTED WORKOUT DEFINITIONS (WOMEN'S ELITE PROGRAMS)

## RESEARCH SUMMARY
Based on REAL women's training programs 2026:
- **Bikini Competitor Programs** (Muscle & Fitness Hers)
- **Female PPL Programs** (16-week women's PPL split)
- **Women's Upper/Lower** (12-week female split programs)
- **Full Body for Women** (3-day complete programs)
- **Legion Athletics** (women-specific training science)

**WHAT'S DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN:**
1. **More lower body volume** - 2 leg days vs 1 upper day is common
2. **Glutes prioritized** - Every leg day includes glutes
3. **Higher rep ranges** - Women handle 10-15 reps better (more Type I muscle fibers)
4. **More isolation** - Women focus on shape, not just size
5. **Shoulders emphasized** - Creates V-taper, balances hips
6. **Less chest volume** - Women don't need heavy bench focus

**Bikini Competitor Structure:**
- Phase 1: Foundation (muscle building)
- Phase 2: Progressive overload (strength + size)
- Phase 3: Definition (leaning out)

## WORKOUT 1: GLUTE SPECIALIZATION
**Focus:** Maximum glute development (2-3x per week glute training)

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - glute foundation)
**Philosophy:** Learn hip thrust + glute activation basics
1. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Hip thrust foundation
2. **Reverse Lunge** (3 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Unilateral glute work
3. **Sumo Squat** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Wide stance glute emphasis

**Why this works:** Bikini prep programs start with bridges, lunges, and wide-stance squats. These teach glute activation without heavy loading. High reps (12-15) match women's muscle fiber composition.

**Female focus:** Glutes 3x per week, minimal quad involvement, learn mind-muscle connection.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete glute development)
**Philosophy:** Heavy hip thrusts + unilateral + isolation
1. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Unilateral strength
2. **Reverse Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute lengthening
3. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute medius (side glute)
4. **Sumo Squat** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Inner glute + adductor
5. **Standing Glute Kickback** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Isolation finisher

**Why this works:** This matches bikini competitor programs: thrust variation + 2 lunge variations (different angles) + squat + isolation. Curtsy lunges build glute medius (creates "shelf"). High-rep kickbacks for pump.

**Female focus:** All exercises minimize quad involvement, maximize glute activation.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - bikini competitor glute day)
**Philosophy:** Maximum volume + variety for complete glute development
1. **Elevated Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Extended ROM hip thrust
2. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Hardest unilateral (glute + quad)
3. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute medius
4. **Sumo Squat Pulse** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Time under tension
5. **Donkey Kick Pulse** (4 sets x 15 reps per leg) - Isolation + pulse
6. **Single Leg RDL** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Hamstring + glute stretch
7. **Frog Pump** (4 sets x 20 reps) - High-rep burnout

**Why this works:** This is EXACTLY what bikini competitors do: heavy compound (elevated bridge, Bulgarian split squats) → medius work (curtsy) → isolation with pulses (kickbacks) → high-rep finisher (frog pumps). 7 exercises = maximum glute volume.

**Female focus:** Every angle covered: hip extension, abduction, external rotation.

---

## WORKOUT 2: UPPER/LOWER SPLIT - UPPER BODY
**Focus:** Shoulders + back for V-taper, light chest work

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - upper body foundation)
**Philosophy:** Learn fundamental upper body patterns
1. **Push-Ups** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Horizontal push (chest + triceps)
2. **Lat Pulldown** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Vertical pull (back width)
3. **Seated Dumbbell Press** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Shoulder development

**Why this works:** Women's upper body programs prioritize: lats (V-taper) + shoulders (balance hips) + light chest. This is the exact structure from 12-week women's programs.

**Female focus:** Shoulders emphasized (creates proportion), minimal heavy pressing.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete upper development)
**Philosophy:** Shoulders + back focus, balanced arms
1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Horizontal push
2. **Seated Cable Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Horizontal pull (mid-back)
3. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Shoulder compound
4. **Lat Pulldown** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Vertical pull (back width)
5. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Side delt isolation

**Why this works:** Women's programs use: 1 chest + 2 back (width + thickness) + 1 shoulder press + 1 lateral raise. More back than chest (women want V-taper, not huge pecs). High-rep lateral raises (15) for shoulder shape.

**Female focus:** 2 back exercises vs 1 chest (V-taper priority), shoulder isolation.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - bikini competitor upper body)
**Philosophy:** Shoulder emphasis + back development + arm detail
1. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper chest (cleavage line)
2. **Dumbbell Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Mid-back thickness
3. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Heavy shoulder work
4. **Pull-Up** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Back width + lat development
5. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Side delt shape
6. **Cable Crossover** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Chest definition
7. **Reverse Fly** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Rear delt (posing muscle)

**Why this works:** Bikini competitors prioritize: shoulders (3 exercises: OHP + lateral raise + rear delt) + back (2 exercises) + light chest (incline + cable). This creates shoulder caps + V-taper + posing-ready back. More shoulder volume than chest (women's aesthetic).

**Female focus:** 3 shoulder exercises, 2 back, only 2 chest (proportion focus).

---

## WORKOUT 3: UPPER/LOWER SPLIT - LOWER BODY
**Focus:** Glutes + hamstrings, controlled quad development

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - lower body basics)
**Philosophy:** Squat + hinge + glute isolation
1. **Goblet Squat** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Squat pattern (glute + quad)
2. **Dumbbell RDL** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Hip hinge (hamstring + glute)
3. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Glute isolation

**Why this works:** Every women's lower program includes: 1 squat + 1 hinge + 1 hip thrust. This builds foundation for all lower body patterns. High reps preserve joints.

**Female focus:** Glute emphasis on all exercises, RDL for hamstring/glute lengthening.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - balanced lower body)
**Philosophy:** Glute emphasis + hamstring work + minimal quad isolation
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Bilateral squat (glute + quad)
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hamstring + glute builder
3. **Walking Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral glute work
4. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Hip thrust variation
5. **Lying Leg Curl** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Hamstring isolation

**Why this works:** Women's programs include: squat + RDL (mandatory) + lunges (unilateral) + hip thrust + leg curl (hamstring). NO leg extensions (women avoid quad growth). More hamstring/glute than quad.

**Female focus:** No leg extensions, double glute work (squats + bridges).

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - bikini competitor legs)
**Philosophy:** Maximum glute + hamstring volume, strategic quad work
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Heavy bilateral squat
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hip hinge, hamstring stretch
3. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral glute/quad
4. **Walking Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Dynamic unilateral
5. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Hip thrust isolation
6. **Lying Leg Curl** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Hamstring isolation
7. **Standing Calf Raise** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Calf development

**Why this works:** Bikini leg day structure: 1 heavy squat + 1 hinge + 2 unilateral (Bulgarian + lunge) + glute isolation + hamstring isolation + calves. More exercises than upper body (legs = priority). Bulgarian split squats are HUGE in bikini world (glute + quad in one).

**Female focus:** 4 glute-dominant exercises, strategic quad work, calves for proportion.

---

## WORKOUT 4: FULL BODY (3x per week program)
**Focus:** Efficient full-body training, glute emphasis each session

### BEGINNER (3 exercises - essential patterns)
**Philosophy:** One exercise per major pattern
1. **Goblet Squat** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Lower body push
2. **Push-Ups** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Upper body push
3. **Lat Pulldown** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Upper body pull

**Why this works:** Research shows women need: 1 lower push + 1 upper push + 1 upper pull for complete full-body. This hits everything in 3 exercises. Perfect for 3x/week training.

**Female focus:** Squat pattern (glutes trained 3x/week), minimal time commitment.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises - complete full-body stimulus)
**Philosophy:** Lower emphasis (2 exercises) + upper compounds
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Lower body compound
2. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper push
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hip hinge (hamstring/glute)
4. **Seated Cable Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper pull (back)
5. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Shoulders

**Why this works:** Women's full-body programs use: 2 lower (squat + hinge) + 1 chest + 1 back + 1 shoulder. This ensures glutes trained 3x/week (squat + RDL both hit glutes). More lower than upper (women's priority).

**Female focus:** 2 lower body exercises (glute frequency), balanced upper.

---

### ADVANCED (7 exercises - high-volume full-body)
**Philosophy:** Complete stimulus with glute priority
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Heavy lower compound
2. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper chest
3. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hip hinge
4. **Pull-Up** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Back width
5. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral glute/quad
6. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Shoulder development
7. **Hanging Leg Raise** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Core (abs for stage)

**Why this works:** This is HIGH-VOLUME full-body: 3 lower (squat + RDL + Bulgarian) + 2 upper push + 1 pull + abs. Women training 3x/week can handle more volume per session (better recovery). Bulgarian split squats add unilateral work. Core work (abs important for bikini).

**Female focus:** 3 lower body exercises = glutes hit hard 3x/week.

---

## WORKOUT 5: PUSH/PULL/LEGS (PPL) - FULL WEEK
**Focus:** Women's PPL (more leg volume than push/pull)

### PUSH DAY - BEGINNER (3 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Chest + shoulders + triceps basics
1. **Push-Ups** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Horizontal push
2. **Seated Dumbbell Press** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Shoulder press
3. **Cable Pushdown** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Tricep isolation

**Why this works:** Women's push day: light chest + shoulder emphasis + tricep toning. No heavy bench (women don't prioritize chest mass).

**Female focus:** Shoulder-dominant, light chest work.

---

### PUSH DAY - INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Balanced pressing + shoulder isolation
1. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Chest compound
2. **Standing Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Shoulder compound
3. **Incline Dumbbell Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Upper chest
4. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Side delt shape
5. **Overhead Tricep Extension** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Tricep work

**Why this works:** 2 shoulder exercises (press + lateral raise) vs 2 chest (flat + incline). Women want shoulder caps more than big pecs. High-rep lateral raises for shape. Tricep work for arm definition.

**Female focus:** Equal chest/shoulder volume (not chest-dominant like men's).

---

### PUSH DAY - ADVANCED (7 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Shoulder priority + chest detail + tricep definition
1. **Incline Barbell Press** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Upper chest (cleavage)
2. **Barbell Overhead Press** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Heavy shoulder work
3. **Dumbbell Bench Press** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Chest volume
4. **Dumbbell Lateral Raise** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Side delt
5. **Cable Crossover** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Chest definition
6. **Reverse Fly** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Rear delt (posing)
7. **Skull Crusher** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Tricep mass

**Why this works:** 3 shoulder exercises (OHP + lateral + rear delt) + 3 chest (incline + flat + cable) + 1 tricep. Bikini competitors LOVE shoulder work (creates proportion). Rear delts for back poses. All three delt heads hit.

**Female focus:** 3 shoulder exercises = shoulder caps + V-taper.

---

### PULL DAY - BEGINNER (3 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Back width + back thickness basics
1. **Lat Pulldown** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Vertical pull (back width)
2. **Seated Cable Row** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Horizontal pull (back thickness)
3. **Cable Bicep Curl** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Bicep toning

**Why this works:** Pull day needs: 1 vertical pull + 1 horizontal pull + biceps. This builds V-taper (lats) + posing muscles (mid-back).

**Female focus:** V-taper priority (lats emphasized).

---

### PULL DAY - INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Complete back development + bicep work
1. **Lat Pulldown** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Vertical pull
2. **Seated Cable Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Horizontal pull
3. **Dumbbell Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Unilateral back work
4. **Reverse Fly** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Rear delt
5. **Dumbbell Bicep Curl** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Bicep shape

**Why this works:** 3 back exercises (vertical + horizontal + unilateral) + rear delt + biceps. Women's programs emphasize back (creates illusion of smaller waist). Rear delts for posing. Biceps for arm definition.

**Female focus:** 3 back movements for complete V-taper development.

---

### PULL DAY - ADVANCED (7 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Maximum back development for stage presence
1. **Pull-Up** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Bodyweight vertical pull
2. **Barbell Bent Over Row** (4 sets x 8 reps) - Heavy horizontal pull
3. **Lat Pulldown** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Vertical pull volume
4. **Dumbbell Row** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Unilateral work
5. **Reverse Fly** (4 sets x 15 reps) - Rear delt isolation
6. **Cable Bicep Curl** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Bicep peak
7. **Hanging Leg Raise** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Core + grip

**Why this works:** Bikini back day: 4 back exercises (2 vertical + 2 horizontal) for complete development. Pull-ups + heavy rows = thickness. Multiple angles = complete back. Rear delts for back double bicep pose. Core work (abs visible from back poses).

**Female focus:** 4 back exercises = maximum V-taper + posing muscles.

---

### LEG DAY - BEGINNER (3 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Glute-focused leg training
1. **Goblet Squat** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Squat pattern
2. **Dumbbell RDL** (3 sets x 12 reps) - Hip hinge
3. **Glute Bridge** (3 sets x 15 reps) - Glute isolation

**Why this works:** Women's PPL leg day = mini glute specialization. Squat + hinge + hip thrust. Every movement emphasizes glutes.

**Female focus:** All exercises glute-dominant.

---

### LEG DAY - INTERMEDIATE (5 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Complete lower body with glute priority
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Bilateral squat
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hamstring + glute
3. **Walking Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral
4. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Hip thrust
5. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute medius

**Why this works:** Squat + RDL + 2 lunge variations + hip thrust. More glute volume than upper body days (women's priority). Curtsy lunges for side glute. Walking lunges for overall glute/quad.

**Female focus:** 5 exercises (vs 5 on push/pull) = equal volume, but all glute-focused.

---

### LEG DAY - ADVANCED (7 exercises)
**Philosophy:** Bikini competitor leg day structure
1. **Barbell Back Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Heavy compound
2. **Romanian Deadlift** (4 sets x 10 reps) - Hip hinge
3. **Bulgarian Split Squat** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Unilateral king
4. **Walking Lunge** (4 sets x 10 reps per leg) - Dynamic movement
5. **Single Leg Glute Bridge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Hip thrust isolation
6. **Curtsy Lunge** (4 sets x 12 reps per leg) - Glute medius
7. **Lying Leg Curl** (4 sets x 12 reps) - Hamstring isolation

**Why this works:** This is MORE exercises than push or pull day (7 vs 7) = women prioritize legs. Includes: 1 squat + 1 hinge + 3 unilateral (Bulgarian + walking + curtsy) + hip thrust + hamstring. Complete glute development from all angles.

**Female focus:** Most volume of any day = legs/glutes are priority.
